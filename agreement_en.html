									<h2>Membership Service Agreement</h2>
									<p>This agreement requires the use of individual arbitration to resolve disputes, rather than jury trials or class actions, and also limits the remedies available to you in the event of a dispute.</p>
									
									<p>This Service Agreement (“Agreement”) sets forth the legally binding terms for your use of any products, programs, and related services developed by Gao jie (hereinafter “we” or “us”). By using any application, you accept this Agreement and represent and warrant that you have the right to enter into this Agreement. If you do not agree to all terms of this Agreement, please do not use any application. This Agreement is the final, complete, and exclusive agreement between you and us regarding the subject matter of this Agreement (including us) and supersedes and merges all prior discussions and agreements between the parties regarding such matters (including any prior end-user license agreements, terms of service, or privacy policies).</p>
									
									<p>1 End-User License Agreement</p>
									
									<p>1.1 License<br/>
									Subject to the terms of this Agreement, we grant you a non-transferable, non-exclusive license to (a) use for your personal use, and (b) copy for the purpose of downloading, installing, and executing authorized copies of each application on computer devices you own or control for your use (“License”).</p>
									
									<p>1.2 Certain Restrictions<br/>
									The rights granted to you by this Agreement are subject to the following restrictions: (a) you may not license, sell, rent, transfer, assign, distribute, host, or otherwise commercially exploit any application; (b) unless expressly prohibited by applicable law, you may not modify, translate, adapt, merge, create derivative works of, disassemble, decompile, reverse compile, or reverse engineer any part of any application; (c) you may not access any application to build a similar or competitive service or application; (d) except as expressly stated herein, no part of any application may be copied, reproduced, distributed, republished, downloaded, displayed, posted, or transmitted in any form or by any means; or (e) you may not remove or destroy any copyright notices or other proprietary markings contained in any application. Unless otherwise specified in connection with such additions, any future releases, updates, or other additions to functionality of any application (including in-app purchases, additional levels, and gameplay enhancements) shall be subject to the terms of this Agreement. All copyright and other proprietary notices on any application content must be retained on any copies.</p>
									
									<p>1.3 Local Laws<br/>
									You are solely responsible for compliance with all applicable laws, including but not limited to export and import regulations.</p>
									
									<p>1.4 Modifications<br/>
									We reserve the right to modify, suspend, or terminate the terms of this Agreement or any part thereof at any time without notice. You agree that we shall not be liable to you or any third party for any modification, suspension, or termination of any application or any part thereof.</p>
									
									<p>1.5 Ownership<br/>
									We provide you with a license, not a sale. Except for your user content (defined below), we (and our licensors, where applicable) own all rights, title, and interest in all our applications, including all related intellectual property rights. This Agreement is not a sale and does not convey to you any ownership rights in any application or related rights. Our name, logo, and product names associated with us belong to us (or our licensors, where applicable), and no right or license to use them is granted by implication, estoppel, or otherwise. We (and our licensors, where applicable) reserve all rights not granted in this Agreement.</p>
									
									<p>2 User Content</p>
									<p>2.1 User Content<br/>
									“User Content” refers to any and all content that a user uploads, distributes, or otherwise provides through any application. You are solely responsible for your User Content. You assume all risks associated with the use of your User Content, including any reliance on its accuracy, completeness, or usefulness by others, or any disclosure of your User Content that makes you or any third party personally identifiable. You hereby represent and warrant that your User Content does not violate the Acceptable Use Policy (defined below). You may not state or imply that your User Content is in any way provided, sponsored, or endorsed by us. We are not obligated to back up any User Content, and User Content may be deleted at any time. You are solely responsible for creating backup copies of your User Content if you desire.</p>
									
									<p>2.2 License<br/>
									By uploading, distributing, or otherwise using your User Content with any application, you automatically grant, and you represent and warrant that you have the right to grant, to us an irrevocable, non-exclusive, royalty-free, and fully paid worldwide license to reproduce, copy, distribute, publicly display, perform, prepare derivative works, incorporate into other works, and otherwise use your User Content, solely for the purpose of displaying your User Content on any application.</p>
									
									<p>2.3 Feedback<br/>
									If you provide us with any feedback or suggestions (“Feedback”), you hereby assign to us all rights in the Feedback and agree that we have the right to use such Feedback and related information in any manner we deem appropriate.

									3.3<br/>
									We may (a) suspend your right to use any application and/or related services at any time for any reason, or (b) terminate this Agreement at our sole discretion, with or without notice to you, including if we in good faith believe you have violated the Acceptable Use Policy or any other provision of this Agreement.

We reserve the right to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter subject to indemnification by you, and you agree to cooperate with our defense of such claims. You agree not to settle any matter without our prior written consent. We will use reasonable efforts to notify you of any such claim, action, or proceeding.</p>
									
									<p>5 Third Parties</p>
									
									<p>5.1 Application Stores<br/>
									You acknowledge and agree that the availability of the applications is dependent on the App Store from Apple Inc. You acknowledge that this Agreement is between you and us, not the App Store. The App Store is not responsible for the applications, their content, maintenance, support services, warranties, or addressing any claims related thereto (e.g., product liability, legal compliance, or intellectual property infringement). You agree to pay all fees (if any) charged by the App Store in connection with the applications. You agree to comply with, and your license to use the applications is conditioned upon your compliance with, all applicable third-party terms of agreement (e.g., the App Store’s terms and policies). You acknowledge that the App Store (and its subsidiaries) are third-party beneficiaries of this Agreement and have the right to enforce it.</p>
									
									<p>5.2 Releases<br/>
									You hereby irrevocably and unconditionally release and forever discharge any third party (and their suppliers) from any and all claims, demands, and rights of action, whether now known or unknown, relating to any interactions with, or acts or omissions of, any third-party services, other users, or third-party advertisers. If you are a California resident, you hereby waive California Civil Code Section 1542, which states: “A general release does not extend to claims that the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him or her must have materially affected his or her settlement with the debtor.”</p>
									
									<p>6 Disclaimer</p>
									
									<p>6.1<br/>
									We provide the applications “as is,” and we (and our suppliers) expressly disclaim all warranties and conditions, whether express or implied, including merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, quiet enjoyment, accuracy, or non-infringement. We (and our suppliers) make no warranty that any application: (a) will meet your requirements; (b) will be available on an uninterrupted, timely, secure, or error-free basis; or (c) will be accurate, reliable, complete, legal, or safe.</p>
									
									<p>6.2<br/>
									Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties, so the above exclusion may not apply to you.</p>
									
									<p>7 Limitation of Liability</p>
									
									<p>7.1<br/>
									In no event shall we (or our suppliers) be liable for any loss of profits or any indirect, consequential, punitive, incidental, special, or exemplary damages arising from or related to this Agreement or our privacy practices with respect to the applications, even if we have been advised of the possibility of such damages. Access to and use of any application is at your own discretion and risk, and you will be solely responsible for any damage to your computer system or mobile device or loss of data resulting therefrom. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, our liability to you for any damages arising from or related to this Agreement or our privacy practices (for any cause whatsoever and regardless of the form of action) will at all times be limited to the amount you paid us in the prior 12 months (if any). In no event shall our suppliers have any liability arising from or related to this Agreement.</p>
									
									<p>7.2<br/>
									Some jurisdictions do not allow the limitation or exclusion of liability for incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you, and you may also have other legal rights that vary by jurisdiction.</p>
									
									<p>8 Fees</p>
									
									<p>You agree to pay all fees and applicable taxes incurred by you or anyone making purchases through the applications. We may modify the prices of goods and services offered through the applications at any time. You acknowledge that we are not required to provide a refund for any reason, and you may initiate a refund request through reportaproblem.apple.com, with refunds processed by Apple upon completion. You will not receive money or other compensation for unused virtual items when you close your account or stop using the applications.</p>
									
									<p>You agree to pay the applicable fees for us and any in-app purchases (e.g., virtual currency, ingots, gems, in-app products, additional levels, and enhancements) downloaded by you (to us or the applicable reseller).</p>
									
									<p>9 General</p>

									This Agreement may be revised from time to time, and if we make any material changes, we may post a notice of the changes on our website to notify you.

									<p>9.3 Severability<br/>
									If any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid or unenforceable for any reason, the remaining provisions of this Agreement will not be impaired, and the invalid or unenforceable provision will be deemed modified to be valid and enforceable to the maximum extent permitted by law.</p>
									
									<p>9.4 Entire Agreement<br/>
									This Agreement is the final, complete, and exclusive agreement between you and us regarding the subject matter of this Agreement (including all applications such as ours) and supersedes and merges all prior discussions and agreements between the parties regarding such matters (including any prior end-user license agreements, terms of service, or privacy policies). Our failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. The section titles in this Agreement are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. The word “including” means including but not limited to. Your relationship with us is that of an independent contractor, and neither party is an agent or partner of the other. This Agreement and your rights and obligations hereunder may not be assigned by you without our prior written consent, and any attempted assignment in violation of the foregoing shall be void. We may assign this Agreement without your consent in connection with a merger, acquisition, reorganization, or sale of all or substantially all of our assets or other operation of law. The terms of this Agreement shall be binding upon assignees.</p>
									
									<p>10 Apple Application Store Additional Terms and Conditions</p>

If any other terms and conditions of this Agreement are less restrictive than, or otherwise conflict with, the terms and conditions of this Section 10, the more restrictive or conflicting terms and conditions in this Section 10 apply, but solely with respect to applications from the Apple App Store.</p>
									
									<p>10.1 Acknowledgment: We and you acknowledge that this Agreement is concluded between us and you only, and not with Apple Inc., and that we, not Apple Inc., are solely responsible for the applications and their content. If the usage rules for the applications set forth in this Agreement are less restrictive than, or otherwise conflict with, the usage rules set forth in the App Store Terms of Service, the more restrictive or conflicting Apple terms apply.</p>
